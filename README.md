# 💼 TechMatch

**TechMatch** is a fun and swipeable, skills-based career matching app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and JavaScript.  
Inspired by match-making apps — but made for job seekers in tech — this project lets users "swipe" through different tech role profiles and get matched based on their interests and skills.

> ✨ A creative project I built and decided to share with the community.
